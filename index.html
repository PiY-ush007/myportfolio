     Hello my name is Piyush, these are some of my projects:  
     </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <hr>
     <h2> 1) Solar system</h2>
     <img src="solar systemGame.jpg"alt=""width="600px"height="300" >
     <br>
     <p>
         This is my solarSystem.
         In this project the sun expands every 10 frames and slowly destroyes all planets.
         <br>
         this is not a game but it's still my favourite
        </p>

         <h2>2) Save the sky</h2>
         <img src="saveTheSky.jpg"alt=""width="400px"height="400px" >
         <p>
             This is my most liked project to date.
             <br>
             In this game you control a fighter jet.
             <br>
             there are wild flying creatures in the sky.
             <br>
             the player has to kill the creatures by shooting bullets at it
             <br>
              before it attacks the city.
              <br>
              <br>
              <hr>
              

         </p>
         
         <h2>3) AngryBirds</h2>
         <img src="angrybirds.jpg"alt=""width="800px"height="250px" >
      
         <p>
             This is a project that i did in the class using physics engine.
             <br>
             this is a "single level" replica of AngryBirds.
             <br>
             I am really proud of this project.

         <h2>4) Car racing game</h2>
         <img src="carRacing.jpg"alt=""width="800"height="400" >
    
         <p>
             This is also a project which i did in class.
             <br>
             I did this project using a real time database.
             <br>
             this is a multiplayer car racing game
             <br> 
             where 4 people can play together.
             <br>
             this was the most interesting project i have done
